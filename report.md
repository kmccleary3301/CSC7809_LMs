# Sequential Neural Networks for Text Generation

## Abstract

In this project, we implemented and compared three different sequential neural network architectures for text generation: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Transformer models. We trained these models on a text corpus from Project Gutenberg using a BPE tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 10,000. We evaluated the models using perplexity and BLEU scores, and compared their text generation capabilities. The results demonstrated the trade-offs between these architectures, with transformers showing superior performance but requiring more computational resources, while LSTMs provided a good balance between performance and efficiency compared to vanilla RNNs.

## Methodology

### Data Preparation

We used a dataset derived from Project Gutenberg, consisting of short text sequences from public domain literature. The data was split into training and testing sets. Before model training, we implemented a subword tokenization approach using the SentencePiece library to create a BPE tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 10,000.

The tokenization process involved:
1. Extracting text from the JSONL dataset files
2. Training a BPE tokenizer on the training data
3. Tokenizing the text into subword units
4. Creating input-target pairs for language modeling

For the language modeling task, we generated overlapping sequences of fixed length (64 tokens) from the tokenized texts, where each input sequence was paired with a target sequence shifted by one token.

### Model Architectures

We implemented three different sequential neural network architectures for text generation:

#### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

The RNN model consisted of:
- An embedding layer mapping token IDs to embeddings (dim=256)
- Two RNN layers with hidden size of 512
- A fully connected output layer mapping hidden states to token probabilities
- Dropout of 0.5 between layers

RNNs process text sequentially, maintaining a hidden state that is updated at each time step. However, they suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, making it difficult to capture long-range dependencies.

#### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

The LSTM model consisted of:
- An embedding layer mapping token IDs to embeddings (dim=256)
- Two LSTM layers with hidden size of 512
- A fully connected output layer mapping hidden states to token probabilities
- Dropout of 0.5 between layers

LSTMs extend the RNN architecture with memory cells and gating mechanisms (input, forget, and output gates) that control information flow, allowing them to better capture long-range dependencies in text.

#### Transformer

The Transformer model consisted of:
- An embedding layer mapping token IDs to embeddings (dim=256)
- Positional encoding to provide sequence order information
- Two transformer encoder layers with:
  - Self-attention mechanism with 2 attention heads
  - Feed-forward network with hidden dimension of 512
- A fully connected output layer mapping hidden states to token probabilities
- Dropout of 0.5

Transformers process the entire sequence in parallel using self-attention mechanisms, which allows them to capture long-range dependencies more effectively than RNNs or LSTMs. They also avoid the sequential nature of RNNs, enabling more efficient training.

### Training Procedure

We trained all models using the following hyperparameters:
- Loss function: CrossEntropyLoss
- Optimizer: AdamW
- Learning rate: 0.001
- Batch size: 128
- Maximum epochs: 30
- Early stopping with patience of 3 epochs
- Learning rate scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau

During training, we monitored both training and validation loss, saving the best model based on validation loss. We also implemented early stopping to prevent overfitting, and a learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate during training.

### Text Generation

For text generation, we implemented an autoregressive decoding method:
1. Encode the prompt text into token IDs
2. Feed the token IDs to the model to predict the next token
3. Append the predicted token to the sequence
4. Repeat until an end-of-sequence token is generated or the maximum length is reached
5. Decode the generated tokens back to text

For graduate students, we implemented temperature sampling where the logits are divided by a temperature parameter before selecting the next token, allowing control over the randomness of the generated text.

### Evaluation Metrics

We evaluated the models using two primary metrics:

1. **Perplexity (PPL)**: A measure of how well the model predicts the next token in a sequence. Lower perplexity indicates better performance.
   - PPL = exp(average cross-entropy loss)

2. **BLEU Score**: A measure of how similar the generated text is to reference text. Higher BLEU score indicates better performance.
   - We generated text samples using prompts from the test set and compared them with the original text.

## Discussion & Conclusion

In this project, we implemented and compared three different sequential neural network architectures for text generation. Our results show that the Transformer model generally outperformed the RNN and LSTM models in terms of both perplexity and BLEU score, which is consistent with the literature. The ability of Transformers to process the entire sequence in parallel and capture long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms gives them an advantage over sequential models like RNNs and LSTMs.

However, this improved performance comes with a computational cost. Transformers require more memory and computation time compared to RNNs and LSTMs, especially for long sequences. LSTMs provide a good balance between performance and efficiency, making them still relevant for many applications.

The project demonstrated the evolution of sequential neural networks from simple RNNs to sophisticated Transformer architectures, highlighting the trade-offs between model complexity, performance, and computational requirements. Future work could explore more advanced architectures, larger models, and different applications of these text generation models.
